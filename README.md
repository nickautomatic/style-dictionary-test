# Basic Style Dictionary

This example code is bare-bones to show you what this framework can do.

Install by running:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Then run Style Dictionary:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

This will take the tokens specified in the `tokens` folder, and the config in `config.json`, and use them to write various formats to the `build` folder.
